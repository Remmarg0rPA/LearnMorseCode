# LearnMorseCode

This is a program that is supposed to help you learn morse code. It will translate the a few sentences of the first paragraph of a random wikipedia article. You can then play the morse code to practice converting the morse code back to letters.

How to use:   
"Play"-button plays the morse code according to the current mode.  
"New"-button creates a new message which can be played.  
"Check Guess"-button checks the guess that you have written in th text box. You have to write all lowercase and it is not guaranteee that it will mark your guess as correct even if you have interpreted the morse code correctly (an extra space between two words is enough to make the check fail).  
"Show Answer"-button shows the answer.  
"Audio"/"lLight"-button changes mode. Audio becomes light and  light becomes auido. This affects the way that the morse is played. Audio plays the morse with sound and light makes the button blink.  

practiceMorse.pyw uses winsoud and thus it can only be used on windows computers. The wikipedia module is also used, so it has to be installed for the program to run.
